### Project
"Carstock" is an automotive sales database, a robust and comprehensive system specifically designed for a global auto sales company. Its primary objective is to facilitate the seamless buying and selling of vehicles by providing a centralized platform for both customers and suppliers. The database schema, implemented using Microsoft SQL Server, includes well-defined tables to store crucial data related to vehicles, customers, suppliers, sales transactions, and other relevant entities.

To ensure the integrity and efficiency of the database, relationships between tables were established using primary keys and foreign keys. This allowed for proper data organization and efficient retrieval of interconnected information. Additionally, a substantial amount of sample data, comprising over 200,000 records, was generated and populated across the various entities.

In order to encapsulate business logic and gain valuable insights from the data, several database objects were implemented. These included the creation of views, which allowed for the retrieval of consolidated vehicle and customer details, as well as functions that enabled the filtering of cars based on color, mileage, and other specifications. Triggers were also utilized to enforce data integrity rules, ensuring that the database maintained consistent and reliable information.

To showcase the practical usage of the database, a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) was developed using C# with ADO.NET. This GUI provided a seamless and intuitive way for users to interact with the database objects. Users could easily browse the full inventory, check for available cars, explore offers, make purchases, and list vehicles for sale. The GUI effectively demonstrated the practical application of the database system in real-world scenarios.
